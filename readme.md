## Course Repository for Systems Programming Class

#### Introduction

For this course we will use private github.com repos in a Drexel student organization on github.com.

In the first week of class you will receive 3 emails related to github: 2 from me with instructions, and 1 from github.com inviting you to our student org. Use these email instructions to set up access and clone the repo.

#### Using your Github repo - step 1 accept org invite

* You will receive an email from your professor with the subjet "CS-503 Github.com Invitation". Refernce the instructions in the email to accept your github.com invitation.
  * The actual invite link you need comes from `noreply@github.com` and will have a subject like "[GitHub] @bdlilley has invited you to join the @drexel-systems-students-cs503 organization".
  * Use the instructions in the "CS-503 Github.com Invitation" email to accept the invitation in the `noreply@github.com` email.

#### Using your Github repo - step 2 access your repo

* After you have accepted the org invite and can log into github.com, follow the intructions in the email titled "CS-503 Github.com Repo Information" from your professor.
* Keeping in mind that a linux environment is required, you should follow the steps in this email from within your linux virtualization platform of choice:

**Option 1 - Drexel Tux** - Tux is a linux cluster provided by the university that you all have access to by default.

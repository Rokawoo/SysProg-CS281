## Warmup Assignment

As mentioned in the course syllabus and in the first lecture this course will require you to use a linux environment for all of your assignments, and to maintain and submit your work in individual folders in a github.com respository that will be provided to you.

The platform options available for this course are:

- Drexel's tux cluster
- WSL on Windows
- Orbstack on MacOs
- Somthing else (vmware, parallels, native linux host, etc.)

The goal of this assignment is for you to decide which linux solution you will use and demonstrate that you can commit code to the provided github.com respository.

#### Directions

This assignment does NOT require you to write any code. The code in the starter folder is intended to help you validate your local environment, and demonstrate that you have correctly set up your github repository.

1. Clone your personal github repo. You received 3 emails related to github: 2 from me with instructions, and 1 from github.com inviting you to our student org. Use these email instructions to set up access and clone the repo. Also **check out the video guide first if you need help**.
2. Add the `0-Warmup` folder **to the root of your personal repo**. You must preserve all folder contents (starter, readme.md, questions.md, etc.). I strongly urge you to use VScode and [this Drexel extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bdlilley.drexel-cci) to manage your assignments. This makes it quick to set up an assignment, and ensures that you are maintaining the required folder structure.
3. Validate code runs - `cd -Warmup/starter` and `make test`. If you are missing any tools, the Drexel extension should have warned you and provided commands to install them.
4. You are not writing or changing any code. The goal is to see it run and print "Hello, world".
5. Answer the questions in questions.md.
6. Commit all your changes and push to your repo.
7. Submit the assignment in Blackboard under the "assignments" section. **The submission in Blackboard must be a link to your solution in your github.com repository; you must submit in Blackboard to signal that you are ready for an assignment to be graded**.

#### Grading

- 10 points: 0-Warmup code submitted 
- 10 points: Questions answered

Total points achievable is 20/20.
